  <h3>RE: YapStone International Ltd (Trading as HolidayRentPayment)</h3>

  <br>

  <h3>IMPORTANT: Confirmation of a Unique Mandate Reference (“UMR”) number change for your existing SEPA Direct Debit Mandate.</h3>

  <br>

  <h3>Dear <%= firstname %> <%= lastname %>:</h3>

  <p>As you are aware, you have previously submitted a signed Direct Debit Mandate form to HolidayRentPayment which we hold on file to facilitate your ability to process refunds through our online payment service.</p>

  <p>In order to ensure that our system complies with the SEPA scheme, we are obliged to change your UMR Number.  This change is necessary to ensure the successful debiting of your account following your initiation of a refund to your customers.  Please note, we have changed no other information regarding your account.  </p>

  <p>Please review the account holder details below for accuracy. If everything is correct, you need do nothing and the new UMR will be automatically applied to your mandate.  If any information is incorrect, please contact us as soon as possible on: <strong>+44-2035143841</strong> or by email at: <a href="mailto:customerservice@holidayrentpayment.eu?subject=New UMR Information">customerservice@holidayrentpayment.eu</a>.</p>

  <p>Going forward, any refunds will be processed as normal. You have the right to cancel your SEPA Direct Debit Mandate at any time by writing to YapStone International Ltd. and informing your bank or Building Society in good time.  Please note that where a Direct Debit Mandate has been cancelled you will no longer have the ability to process refunds through our system. </p>



  <br>

  <p> Sincerely, </p>
  <p> Yapstone </p>
